When you start your ops shift, complete the following steps in order.  

The [during your ops shift](/daily-playbook/During-your-ops-shift) page will describe how to prioritse any issues you notice whilst going through these initial checks.

1. ### Announcing the start of your Ops shift
Update the description of the [#appcon-incidents channel](https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/messages/appcon-incidents/) in Slack to show your name.  Use the format shown below (do not add any claims about the service status in the topic, as these are unlikely to remain up to date).
